    "description": "Every big IT organisation relies heavily on processes. It can take days, if not weeks, to obtain a VM for your new service. If this is not hard enough, all these steps are usually done manually through a ticketing system where teams are siloed over roles and responsibilities. In this talk we would like to demonstrate that technologies, like Openstack, can empower self-service for any R&D team. In the end, creating a VM & deploying an application can be as simple as talking to an assistant.",
